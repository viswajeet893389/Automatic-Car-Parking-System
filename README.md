**Working**

1. The password is entered in the virtual terminal (or the RFID tag is scanned over RFID reader).

2. The 8051 microcontroller checks whether that password is stored in the database or not. If the password matches with the password entered by the user, the motors, which are connected with the output pins of the 8051 microcontroller, rotates clockwise.

3. After some delay the motor rotates anticlockwise indicating closing of gate, simultaneously the LCD displays the strings like “Door Closing”, “Door Opening” etc. while the whole operating takes place.
